WP Gif Player: an easy to use GIF Player for Wordpress

This plugin lets you add and play GIFs on your Wordpress page easily.
Simply install the plugin, activate it and create a new post. Click the "Add GIF" button above the text editor and upload a GIF
into the media uploader window, insert it into the post.
The plugin will then insert a shortcode into your editor, which will be interpreted as a GIF on your site.
When you save your post, the first frame of each Gif will be extracted and displayed on your website with the GIF button on top of it.
If you click the button, the GIF will be played. Click again, and the first frame plus GIF button are displayed again.
